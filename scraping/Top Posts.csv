5,"Hey r/Dota2 Mods. If you wanna join the shutdown on 12th june, you have my full support.","Not sure how you think about it, but I probably wont use Reddit anymore when I am forced to use the official app.

In case you haven't heard about this issue yet, here is some context, thanks to /u/peeteep :

>What's going on?A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

Edit: As many people didn't know there were 3rd party apps and were asking why many people use them, I've put together some screenshots for comparison, between the official app and my personal choice Reddit is Fun: [https://imgur.com/a/4IOSLfp](https://imgur.com/a/4IOSLfp) .

*This is a scheduled Weibo. After all these years, I still can’t let go of the hatred in my heart, and I can’t reconcile with myself. I also know that I’m sorry for many people. It’s all because of me. Let’s end it.*

https://preview.redd.it/80j4fla91r2b1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=da8496abcf9b754d6234361727bd8129effdc3bb

*I was born in a small city in Hebei in 1997, in a family compound, in an ordinary worker's family.My father is a veteran, after retiring transferred to work in China Railway, and then settled here. My mother is from Hubei. After coming here with my sister, she married my father through introduction. Both of them had a failed marriage before, which was also a failure. Then there was me in the second year of marriage.*

*As far as I can remember, I lived with my mother most of the time when I was a child, and my father was on the construction site all year round because of the project, which also caused me to spend very little time with my father in my childhood. In addition, my father has a withdrawn personality, has a strange temper, and doesn’t talk to me much. We only meet once a year or once every two years, so when I was very young, I always asked my mother when my father would come back. I was able to see it during the Chinese New Year, and I kept talking non-stop, and he basically replied perfunctorily, that I basically didn't get any fatherly love.*

*Living in this family compound, there are so many children, logically speaking, childhood should be very happy, but for me, this is all a nightmare and pain. I was particularly impressed by the adults in the yard. When I was very young, they looked at me differently. Many parents would not let their children play with me. At first I thought it was because our family conditions were not good, or I'm a little naughty, and I will know the reason when I grow up, and I will talk about it later. After several twists and turns, I still integrated into the circle of children of the same age. Although I still suffered from some bullying occasionally, it didn’t matter anymore. The most painful memory for me should be the thing of being bullied by boys older than me. At that time, I was still in kindergarten, and those children were already junior high school students. That summer, when I came out from home and ate strawberries, I was seen by several older children. They held imitation gun toys and told me to play, and pushed me into an abandoned apartment building. Four or five people held my hand. My limbs poured urine on me, opened my mouth on the spot, and kept urinating. Then I ran home crying and vomiting all the way. Another time, it was also three or four people who dragged me to the corner of the compound to make me suck their cock. That time I didn't give in, and the crying attracted the adults, so they gave up. When I grew up, I realized that it was not only me who was bullied, but also girls of my age. It was hard to imagine what they would go through. Moreover, many of these older children are children of leaders, born in powerful families, but they are really assholes. I will never forget this memory.*

*As time goes by, it's time for me to go to elementary school, because my comprehension ability may be worse than that of children of the same age. In addition, when I was young, I was inattentive and a little hyperactive. My first test in the first grade was very poor. I remember that the earliest subjects at that time were only Chinese and mathematics. Many children got full marks. But for me, one of them just passed and the other failed. When I got home, I was scolded and beaten. That was the first time I started to resist learning from the bottom of my heart. I said that I really didn't understand...I didn't learn...My mother just thought that I didn't pay attention to the class, and my parents had a very low level of education, especially me. Mom, she can't help me. Later, I spent money on cram school, and my grades in the second and third grades were slightly better.*  *Grades 4, 5 and 6 my head teacher changes, and at this time some children began to collect protection fees, and they would fight you if you didn’t pay. After that, the frequency of my fights became more and more frequent. I was called to the office and framed. I was stupid, I was bad at defending myself, the teacher didn't believe me, and I was the one who was beaten and punished in the end. The school teachers in small cities punished people really outrageously, really beat them, slapped their mouths, whipped people with soft pencils, and beat them with sticks. It was also at that time, my grades were mediocre at that time, I started to get tired of studying, I didn't want to go to school, I didn't want to go to school, I started to pretend to be sick, and skipped classes.*  *Completely tired of studying, it should be an incident in the sixth grade. The door lock in the class was broken by someone. I happened to be cleaning after school. A few students fought and broke the door lock. Then I ran to tell the teacher , I broke it, and they testified to each other, the teacher didn’t believe what I said, in front of so many teachers in the office, they kept hitting my palms with soft pencils, and they were all smashed, let me admit it quickly, I was really at that time Knowing what it means* *extort confessions under torture* *, in the end I really couldn't stand the pain and admitted it. I also bought a new lock for the class to change. I never wanted to go to school at that time. Some people will ask why you didn't tell your mother, because of the academic performance, I have already separated from my mother. At this time, in the eyes of my relatives and family members, I am already a poor student and a bad boy. If I don't study hard, I will secretly go online. , I don't care anymore, I don't want to say anything to them.*

*After entering junior high school, our class teachers in the first and second grades were all physical education teachers. In addition, my previous foundation was not well established, and I continued to be tired of studying in junior high school, chatting and fighting in class all day long. The first two years were spent with corporal punishment education and parents. This period was also my rebellious period. My father also transferred back from work, and my parents quarreled all day long. This is true. Every day, all the time, we are arguing, really all the time. The sound insulation of the old-fashioned buildings is very poor. The sound of our family’s quarrel can be heard in the whole courtyard. In addition to my school’s affairs, I also have endless quarrels with my family. On the one hand, I don't want to go home, and I'm already a little depressed. During that time, I skipped classes and played dota online, all night long. Went to sleep at school the next day. Later, it was also during this period that I knew, a thing that broke me down. Let’s not talk about how I know, I know that I was not born to my parents, but the illegitimate child of relatives, and then they found my father as a successor in order to cover up their mistakes, and I was born soon after the second year of marriage. , This is also the reason why the children in the yard have been bullying me since I was a child, and the adults looked at me strangely and refused to let their children play with me. I really broke down at that moment, and it was at that time that I suffered from depression. I became more and more disgusted with myself, and I hated my family more and more. At that time, I really didn’t want to live anymore. One day in the second semester of the second year of junior high school, I bought sleeping pills. At that time, the regulations on sleeping pills were not as strict as they are now. I committed suicide, but didn't eat enough to die. Later, the teacher came to our house for a home visit and asked me why, but I didn't say anything, I just said that I was not happy and that my life was meaningless. The head teacher is probably also afraid of taking responsibility. After that, all the teachers’ attitudes towards me have changed. At least they never bothered me when I slept in class, hhhh.*

*After entering the third year of junior high school, except for the change of the head teacher, the teachers of other subjects did not change. At this time, I met, the second good teacher in my life. The first one was Teacher Cai in the first three grades of elementary school. The teacher's surname is Tian. He is our chemistry teacher. It may also be because of my second year of junior high school... I can't control my emotions when I write here. After he took over our class, he talked to the students one by one. He was the first and only teacher who said he wanted to be my friend, he always encouraged me, he said you are no worse than anyone else, you have to be confident. In the third year of junior high school, my depression eased a lot, and I also studied hard for a year, but because I had left too much behind, I couldn't even catch up. In the end, I still failed the high school entrance examination, and then left home to study in Shijiazhuang. I don't want to continue living in this city either. I don't want to go back to this home.*

*The three years of studying and living in Shijiazhuang were one of the few happy times in my life, and my depression rarely broke out. Brand new environment + brand new friends and classmates, I am actively studying, I joined the student union and became a minister. Basketball + exercise + dota I have a very fulfilling overall life. The only legacy is the first official love in my life in the last stage of the semester, and I was cuckolded. I didn't have a relationship for the next five years.*

*After graduating, I went to China Railway for an internship, and I happened to stay in Shijiazhuang. At that time, Shijiazhuang was constructing the subway. and my major was surveying, so I stayed there. Maybe the first time I began to work, many things broke my cognition. Hypocrisy and flattery in the workplace, intrigue among colleagues, false reporting of data, cutting corners by construction units, project managers who have families behind their backs to find mistresses... This world is really different from what I imagined. I was very serious in the first half of the year. In the next six months, I was thinking about what I wanted to do, and basically I didn't have any enthusiasm for work. Later, I resigned directly when I was working on the project I was working on. Leaving Shijiazhuang. Do a commentator.*

*My depression broke out completely in mid-March 2019, and my father passed away due to illness. I was tortured by the disease for nearly several months, and finally passed away in pain. In the last few days, I have been by his side. Looking at him, thinking back on his life, two failed marriages, being bullied by others in the workplace, and finally being tortured to death by illness. After the funeral, I went back to my rented house in Shanghai in April. During that time, I talked to myself all night in the room, banging my head against the wall in pain. I looked in the mirror every day, and I was disgusted when I saw myself in the mirror. The more I grow up, the more I look like my biological father. I can’t count how many times I have smoked myself in the mirror. This state has continued until the last two or three days. I laughed out of control and said to myself, I really can't do it. In recent years, I have started to squander money to fill the void in my heart. I can't find the meaning of life, and I can't reconcile myself with the past. Many people have said to me, you are not to blame for this matter, don't blame yourself for other people's faults, you have to live your own life. You could also say it's my excuse to escape from real life, a weak, useless piece of shit. whatever. Without me, there wouldn’t be this, this family that shouldn’t be there, and there wouldn’t be so many things that shouldn’t be there. This family came into existence because of me, and today I killed myself, and it ends with me. Everything was wrong from the beginning, and now this mistake can be corrected. My own inner pain can finally be over, and I leave today with a smile on my face. Many people die and are born every second in this world, without me, this world will not lack anything. I don't want to come to this world in my next life. I also hope that you will not create a tragic family for your own selfish desires or to cover up your mistakes in the future.* Dota2\_Yammers

*Please forgive my selfishness and cowardice, and please understand my pain and struggle. goodbye*

12,American goons perspective of getting DQ'd/Banned by PGL,"I'm logical, the manager of NA DPC div 2 team American goons, and through a series of unfortunate misunderstandings we've just been **Disqualified from this DPC season and banned(?) from ALL future PGL events**. This means that we have almost no tournaments to play for the next 6 months as this is our last opportunity to get a slot in the DPC to play TI qualifiers.
 
&nbsp;
 
Context: We're an NA team with notable players (boris, esK, Lil_Nick, Giant and pingu) and no slot, so we're trying to qualify for the DPC from open qualifiers. We won open qualifiers with few issues and made it to closed qualifiers. We won our closed qualifier games until the upper bracket finals where we lost 2-0 to GRIN esports. GRIN is a solid team and it took us 54 minutes to beat them in open qualifiers. We're a Division 2 NA team and we're inconsistent. We got crushed in lanes game 1 and game 2 we just got outplayed. FYI, GRIN won 2-0 against Fart Studios in the upper bracket. **When we played against GRIN, we had no idea who we would be playing in the lower bracket finals as the match to determine our opponent had not been played yet.**

&nbsp;
 
After our upper bracket loss, we won our final match against GateKept to secure our spot in the DPC. Everyone kind of knows each other in this scene and Napkin and AlienManaBanana (two of the GateKept players) messaged our players asking how or why we lost to GRIN because they believed us to be the better team. Our players jokingly said that we lost so that we'd **GATEKEEP** them. Here are the full chatlogs of both of the interactions:
 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1096582294933868597/1111373125578391582/image.png
 
 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1108223720331415592/1111121895354531930/image.png.
 
We are committed to fair play and would never compromise our competitive integrity by intentionally gatekeeping a team from the DPC in such a petty manner. Regardless, the GateKept players went forward and submitted these messages to the PGL admins. **The investigation was held overnight and had concluded by the following morning.** When we woke up, we were informed by the PGL admins that we had been disqualified.

https://i.imgur.com/FIjXyhC.png
&nbsp;
 
We tried to talk to the admin team to explain that it was a misunderstanding, but after limited reponse they did not seem eager to have a conversation. Our request for evidence showing that we lost on purpose has not been fulfilled. All we have been told is that one of our players said that we lost the games intentionally.
 
&nbsp;
 
What we said, though very common in DOTA, could be construed at most as in bad taste, but getting disqualified over a private chat message with no proof of match-fixing doesn't make sense. The ""evidence"" is private messages between two players who have established rapport (esK and Napkin were DPC teammates and AlienManaBanana and Lil_Nick had played third-party tournaments together earlier this year). [Aui_2000 reviewed our matches and concluded that we were ""playing to win.""](https://twitter.com/Aui_2000/status/1662028253630963712?s=20) **Furthermore the people who are pushing for our disqualification are the same people who would receive our slot if we are disqualified.** THIS IS A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST

&nbsp;
 

We appreciate PGL doing their due diligence, but with this new information, we hope that this decision can be overturned.
 
**All players and personnel involved in this situation from the side of American goons swear that they have never match-fixed.**

Thank you to everyone showing support on the Reddit and Twitter threads. It has been truly humbling and inspiring seeing the community band together for this.

18,We Demand the return of the 'Last Chance Qualifier' for TI12!!,"Looking at the recent TI announcement, there was no mention whatsoever of the return of the LCQ seen at TI11. I think this is a massive shame and reflects a bigger issue than some may realise. Here is a list of reasons why it should be brought back just off the top of my head:

1. Helps to fill the draught between Bali and TI. 3 months is a long time.

2. Important for the competitive health of the scene; two of the three tops teams from last year's TI came from the LCQ. Clearly it is an effective way to raise the competitive standards of TI, rather than lower them.

3. Allows for a greater opportunity for regions with less spots to be visible at TI. This feels especially important this year as one of the weakest regions has disproportionally too many slots (China) whilst one of the better performing regions has too few (SA).

4. The LCQ was by far the most positively received feature of the past several years of pro Dota. To abandon the LCQ would signify that Valve literally does not care about the feedback it receives and would increase hostility and frustration between the playerbase and Valve.

5. The current DPC point allocation system arguably rewards teams that 'gatekeep' their region too much. A team like say Quest eSports gets shafted so hard by being unable to attend LANS due to playing in a hard region. They have to pin all their hopes on one final qualifier. To me it feels wrong that THE INTERNATIONAL is so reliant on regional play to decide it's slots. The LCQ gives these teams another chance to make it and lessens this issue. 

6. Tier 1.5/Tier 2 Dota will have literally NOTHING to do for about 4, maybe even 5 months. Between The regional qualifiers and next year's DPC tour there will be MONTHS where the majority of this game's pro scene will have nothing whatsoever to do. Other than compete in nickel and dime tier 3 tournaments. Getting a large number of these players to compete in a mini-TI before the main thing seems like a super healthy way to stimulate the wider scene.

7. Last year's LCQ got good views. Surely a tournament with no need to hire a venue, being played entirely out of hotel rooms, with those kinds of views would be profitable.

8. Will combat the current popular view from the community that Valve is shrinking TI, only playing the last few days of the tourney in the main venue. If the number of teams shrinks too this will just add to that perception.


TLDR; from an outside perspective the LCQ is a no-brainer. We need to keep the pressure up with posts like this if there is any chance to bring this excellent part of TI back, before we are too close to the event for it to be viable.",13edqww,2532,258,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/13edqww/we_demand_the_return_of_the_last_chance_qualifier/

23,HELP! My friends keep making fun of me for picking Hoodwink,"I have a problem. Every game, I pick Hoodwink. It isn't because I'm like a furry or something. I just like how her character plays. They make fun of me and say stuff, like, if I wanna *do* her or something. It's so weird!

&#x200B;

I mean, Hoodwink is definitely an adult based on her lore, but that would still be weird. Sure, she might be in her early-to-mid twenties at the time of the Tomo'kan Incarnation, but she's literally a squirrel. And even though she is certainly intelligent enough to give or receive consent, she's still a squirrel! It's crazy to even think about! Even ignoring the fact that based on her leg-to-body ratio she's definitely of sexual maturity for her species, why would you even say that? Just because, based on in-game measurements, she's large enough to... ""accommodate"" a human, it would **still** be weird.

&#x200B;

I bet they're probably projecting. When they see Hoodwink's adorable green hood in-game they're probably thinking weird stuff like, ""Wow, I wish I could be with her"". I'm not sure what's more disturbing: that they're projecting their sexual fantasies onto the game, or that they're projecting their sexual fantasies onto *me*.

&#x200B;

I bet they could envision their longing gazes, their hearts aflutter with anticipation as they yearned for her to wield the bola with exquisite precision as she lets loose a bushwack. How they secretly craved the moment when her agile paws would release the swirling cords, ensnaring their helpless limbs, and tethering them against the sturdy embrace of a majestic tree. With a mischievous sparkle in her eyes, they probably imagine Hoodwink would scurry up, her soft voice caressing their ears, and a tempting whisper would escape her squirrely lips, ""wanna see what we do for fun around here?"" Their breath would probably hitch, a delicate whimper escaping their lips, captivated by the allure of her sultry geographically specific accent,  resonating with the seductive charm that echoed through her voice as she says ""starting to feel a bit nutty"". But, uh, thoughts like that are weird, and I certainly do NOT think about them.

Or Circlet, it was “Circlet of Nobility”!

Nowadays, we get item names like Crown or Diadem, skill names like Dispose or Unleash. It’s overly simple, doesn’t feel like it has a lore or a back story that goes with it.

71,Xcalibur opens up in SingSing's stream,"Sing invited him for some unranked games yesterday and Sing pointed out (in a nice way) that Xcalibur's ranked went down by quite a lot, cause last time he checked he was like Rank 1 or something. I couldn't quite interpret some of the stuffs he said but basically his response was 

""I always had problems with my mental state really. So basically my confidence (not ranked confidence) has a lot to do with my mmr actually. And which is very unhealthy. That's something I'm working on and  have to overcome.""  

""I talked with a therapist and I found out that I have like this problem that I take too much responsibility. Ever since like ever since I played. Because every time I lost and I do allow myself to fail because from a very young age since when I started playing I got blamed most of losses. So basically I didn't allow myself to fail (anymore) And it just made confidence worse when I started failing.""


Basically his point is, there are some days where he just doesn't feel as confident about himself in games. There are times where things don't go the way he thought it would be, and then he starts questioning like ""How did this happen?"" and lose confidence. And it affects his games a lot.  


  
People have good days, and bad days. Pointing out their mistakes (in a nice way) isn't that bad but being toxic to someone and telling them stuff like quit/uninstall dota, to hurt, or even kill themselves etc is just immature and unacceptable behavior.",13y7d58,1262,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/13y7d58/xcalibur_opens_up_in_singsings_stream/

81,7.33c changelogs are not reliable nowadays. Really disappointed.,"Every single patch I just simply DEMO the changes, there's always something basic wrong or unchanged. Honestly, I'm disappointed about the quality of the patches they bring.

Here's what I found in this patch :

    1. PANGOLIER : SWASHBUCKLE Dash Range decreased from 850 to 550/650/750/850

It is unchanged, still 850.

[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota2-Gameplay/issues/9193](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota2-Gameplay/issues/9193)

    2. EARTHSHAKER FISSURE Fissure Range increased from 1400 to 1600

It is unchanged, still 1400.

[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota2-Gameplay/issues/9194](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota2-Gameplay/issues/9194)

    3. SPECIALIST'S ARRAY (+5 all attributes, +12 damage ) 
    Crackshot now deals 20 bonus damage Crackshot now prioritizes heroes as secondary targets

When a ranged hero equips it, the raw +12 damage is replaced with +20 damage until Crackshot is cd.

It should be the raw +12 damage added up to bonus +20 = +32 ?

What's more, when a meele hero equips it, it **always gives raw +20 damage rather than raw +12 damage and crackshot never goes to cooldown.**

[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota2-Gameplay/issues/9192](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota2-Gameplay/issues/9192)

&#x200B;

I can't imagine some of the guys thought their hero is buff or nerf , but actually the changelog is not applied yet.

&#x200B;

**\[UPDATE\]**

1. They have fixed the issues of Earthshaker and Pangolier.
2. SPECIALIST'S ARRAY now deals +32 raw damage until crackshot is into cooldown. **But meele hero still always has the free +32 raw damage because crackshot never goes into cooldown.**

Only one issue left and thank you some of the employees who quickly fix these. Now I can enjoy the earthshaker buff !

\[UPDATE 2 \] All has been fixed perfectly!

They have fixed SPECIALIST'S ARRAY ! Meele hero no long has free +32 raw damage now! Thanks everyone and thank you valve employee for the hard work!",13hba53,1206,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/13hba53/733c_changelogs_are_not_reliable_nowadays_really/
