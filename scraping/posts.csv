15,,bipolar,"For Context: I have been diagnosed with PTSD and BP-1 Disorder. I normally do sublingual tablets under the tongue for my ketamine treatments (prescription) that I do at my house. But as the anniversary of the PTSD-related trauma is happening this week, he referred me to do an IV ketamine infusion instead. I've also done nebulizer treatments with him. 

It was a completely different experience with ketamine in the IV treatment I've never experienced before when comparing to the nebulizer treatment and the sublingual tablets. There was an anesthesiologist on staff that talked to me before, we did a 40mg infusion, which I told him I didn't want to do anymore than that since he said he a low dosage of ketamine would most likely be more intense than what i've experienced before with other treatments. He was right...but it was in a good way.

It was the first time I was ever able to 'completely' dissociate away from reality, and was able to revisit the trauma surrounding my PTSD...but while I was under that 'spell' it felt like I was in a mentally safe space to be able to go back to some intense trauma-related emotions about it. Definitely cried (not like sobbing or anything out of control) during most of the treatment infusion time, which hasn't happened with me with the nebulizer or sublingual tablet treatments. The anesthesiologist checked in on me every 5 - 10 minutes to make sure I was staying calm, and to remind me I was in a safe space and that it was okay to cry. 

It already feels like a weight has been lifted off of my chest. I've been undergoing ketamine treatments for almost two years now through my psychiatrist, and it's been helping me tremendously on my mental health journey of feeling stable and not 'spiraling'; but again, today was the first time it was IV. 

Has anyone experienced doing different types of ketamine (prescription) treatments? Did you find the IV seemed to 'work' more?

My wife and I have been together since 2013 and married since Oct. of 2018. Before we started dating I told her about my illness and all of the symptoms that come with it, including mania and psychosis. I tend to become manic during the holidays and start to recover in this spring. This season was the worst bout of mania I’ve ever experienced. A friend of mine lives in New York and invited me up for his birthday celebration. Drinking, drugs and situations of excitement severely impact mania. My wife and I have a 14 month old, our first child together. Getting out of the house for a night in the city was incredibly exciting. The first sign of real mania was me putting my card down for a $1,400 dinner tab. The second was binge drinking. The third was buying a VIP section in the club we went to, another $5,000. I live a comfortable life but in no way do I have any business spending that much money. The last sign was when I started to take drugs. Cocaine and Molly. Things I haven’t touched for a decade. By this time I was in complete psychosis. At some point I disappeared from the group and received oral sex from someone in the club. I don’t know the person and can hardly remember it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to multiple doctors to ensure I am clean after multiple tests for STDs. The only thing that holds me back from having peace of mind is the possibility of having HPV. It’s been since January 14th and I’ve been stuck. Do I tell her and risk ruining our marriage, her ability to trust me and probably anyone else, or risk breaking up our family and seeing my son grow up with a split household? We haven’t had sex since January 14th and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to touch her again. I know it’s wrong and no matter how bad I want to I can’t bring myself to do it.

22,,bipolar,"Hey 


I’ve always had pretty low self esteem and my brain gets stuck in the past a lot. Like daily. My brain flashes back to the parts of me that were I was at my lowest. When my behavior was awful, cringe or plain sad I suffer from BPD, BP with major depression.  (I’ve been in therapy for 4 years &amp; stable on meds for 2) 

My body was hit with a chronic pain disorder and it’s really awful. I couldn’t even walk for a few weeks. Somehow, I’ve made 2 dreams come true; become a full timer writer and financially support myself. 

As a disabled person it’s a miracle to be functional enough to work a full time job. another miracle that I can work remotely and that my salary is really good (unless you live in an over price city like New York. 🙋🏽‍♀️) 

Life is still hard but I’m really lucky, especially given my circumstances. 
But it’s so hard to be proud of myself and let the past go to the parts of my brain I don’t need to rewind to. I can’t emotionally connect with being proud of myself anymore. I can’t connect my gratitude for certain things to my actions. I’m grateful to have a roof over my head, but I can’t link that back to the positive ways I’m living my life. 

Yes, Life has been but there are things I’ve done that have made it harder. 

But the way every mistake I’ve made resurfaces is haunting. The scenes are more powerful than my ability to live in the moment. I want to change the way my brain operates and I don’t really know how. Affirmations and scripting has help me to have a base level amount of self respect and love. That’s pretty miraculous but I also don’t credit myself for the change, I say it happened because I refuse to be in constant pain and being disrespected by someone. 

I’ve had waves of it being easier to feel pride but it’s just until it the accomplishment become part of the mundane. 

I wonder what people without mental illnesses think about every day. 

Do they feel so overwhelmed by their thoughts?  Does speaking to people feels like a chore? 

I really want to be happy. Live in the moment, embodying the pride I should feel rather than shame.

26,,bipolar,"I'm not looking for really anything just want to vent and hope someone can relate.

Ive been in and out of mental wards 5x. Im in my early 20's I'm very introverted and socially awkward. 
I've always been told to be extroverted it will make you happy because humans are meant to make connections with others. 

Anytime I socialize I over share , I have 2 friends and I'm pretty sure they both hate me because 1 never responds the other just ghosts me. Said I was thinking about offing myself to 1 of them (havnt talked to this 1 friend since highschool just recently started talking and hung out 1x) I had a crush on them in highschool they are very aware of it but years after I see this person as a friend, nothing more. 

They said to go get therapy but I can't because I have no insurance, can't get a job because legally I can't drive due to double vision nor can my mom drop me off at any job because of her own job. 

I try to be social like going to a local fair we have every year but I have no friends and my mom won't go with me.

I have ADHD, Panic Disorder, BPD (I think it's autism because it doesn't happen unless I'm over stimulated) OCD, and insomnia.

Havnt seen a physician in 4 years so no telling what problems I have physically.

I forget to drink water and eat. My right kidney is in constant pain, severe migraine. I can't ask for help because my brother needs mental help and has asked for some help, I don't want to worry my mom and family because they think I'm doing so good and I'm happy. 

Truth is, I'm scared to be happy because for over 20 years , I'll be doing good in life, happy ect. Then shit hits the fan, rinse and repeat.
 
Don't want to be happy anymore I just want to die. My grandmother offed herself June 16 a few years ago. As little as I met her as a child around June I'm nothing but depressed and when I realize what month it is it hits different. I can't off myself because I know it would push a family member to drink again and I can't do that to them plus if I fail I'll be admitted back to the ward. 

I will not go out of my way to off myself but at the same time I'll just let natural selection happen and hope it does the job.
