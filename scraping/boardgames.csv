,bipolar,"For Context: I have been diagnosed with PTSD and BP-1 Disorder. I normally do sublingual tablets under the tongue for my ketamine treatments (prescription) that I do at my house. But as the anniversary of the PTSD-related trauma is happening this week, he referred me to do an IV ketamine infusion instead. I've also done nebulizer treatments with him. 

It was a completely different experience with ketamine in the IV treatment I've never experienced before when comparing to the nebulizer treatment and the sublingual tablets. There was an anesthesiologist on staff that talked to me before, we did a 40mg infusion, which I told him I didn't want to do anymore than that since he said he a low dosage of ketamine would most likely be more intense than what i've experienced before with other treatments. He was right...but it was in a good way.

It was the first time I was ever able to 'completely' dissociate away from reality, and was able to revisit the trauma surrounding my PTSD...but while I was under that 'spell' it felt like I was in a mentally safe space to be able to go back to some intense trauma-related emotions about it. Definitely cried (not like sobbing or anything out of control) during most of the treatment infusion time, which hasn't happened with me with the nebulizer or sublingual tablet treatments. The anesthesiologist checked in on me every 5 - 10 minutes to make sure I was staying calm, and to remind me I was in a safe space and that it was okay to cry. 

It already feels like a weight has been lifted off of my chest. I've been undergoing ketamine treatments for almost two years now through my psychiatrist, and it's been helping me tremendously on my mental health journey of feeling stable and not 'spiraling'; but again, today was the first time it was IV. 

Has anyone experienced doing different types of ketamine (prescription) treatments? Did you find the IV seemed to 'work' more?

I tend to become manic during the holidays and start to recover in this spring. This season was the worst bout of mania I’ve ever experienced. A friend of mine lives in New York and invited me up for his birthday celebration. Drinking, drugs and situations of excitement severely impact mania. My wife and I have a 14 month old, our first child together. Getting out of the house for a night in the city was incredibly exciting. The first sign of real mania was me putting my card down for a $1,400 dinner tab. The second was binge drinking. The third was buying a VIP section in the club we went to, another $5,000. I live a comfortable life but in no way do I have any business spending that much money. The last sign was when I started to take drugs. Cocaine and Molly. Things I haven’t touched for a decade. By this time I was in complete psychosis. At some point I disappeared from the group and received oral sex from someone in the club. I don’t know the person and can hardly remember it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to multiple doctors to ensure I am clean after multiple tests for STDs. The only thing that holds me back from having peace of mind is the possibility of having HPV. It’s been since January 14th and I’ve been stuck. Do I tell her and risk ruining our marriage, her ability to trust me and probably anyone else, or risk breaking up our family and seeing my son grow up with a split household? We haven’t had sex since January 14th and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to touch her again. I know it’s wrong and no matter how bad I want to I can’t bring myself to do it.

,bipolar,"Hey 


I’ve always had pretty low self esteem and my brain gets stuck in the past a lot. Like daily. My brain flashes back to the parts of me that were I was at my lowest. When my behavior was awful, cringe or plain sad I suffer from BPD, BP with major depression.  (I’ve been in therapy for 4 years &amp; stable on meds for 2) 

My body was hit with a chronic pain disorder and it’s really awful. I couldn’t even walk for a few weeks. Somehow, I’ve made 2 dreams come true; become a full timer writer and financially support myself. 

As a disabled person it’s a miracle to be functional enough to work a full time job. another miracle that I can work remotely and that my salary is really good (unless you live in an over price city like New York. 🙋🏽‍♀️) 

Life is still hard but I’m really lucky, especially given my circumstances. 
But it’s so hard to be proud of myself and let the past go to the parts of my brain I don’t need to rewind to. I can’t emotionally connect with being proud of myself anymore. I can’t connect my gratitude for certain things to my actions. I’m grateful to have a roof over my head, but I can’t link that back to the positive ways I’m living my life. 

Yes, Life has been but there are things I’ve done that have made it harder. 

But the way every mistake I’ve made resurfaces is haunting. The scenes are more powerful than my ability to live in the moment. I want to change the way my brain operates and I don’t really know how. Affirmations and scripting has help me to have a base level amount of self respect and love. That’s pretty miraculous but I also don’t credit myself for the change, I say it happened because I refuse to be in constant pain and being disrespected by someone. 

I’ve had waves of it being easier to feel pride but it’s just until it the accomplishment become part of the mundane. 

I wonder what people without mental illnesses think about every day. 

Do they feel so overwhelmed by their thoughts?  Does speaking to people feels like a chore? 

I really want to be happy. Live in the moment, embodying the pride I should feel rather than shame.

,bipolar,"I'm not looking for really anything just want to vent and hope someone can relate.

Ive been in and out of mental wards 5x. Im in my early 20's I'm very introverted and socially awkward. 
I've always been told to be extroverted it will make you happy because humans are meant to make connections with others. 

Anytime I socialize I over share , I have 2 friends and I'm pretty sure they both hate me because 1 never responds the other just ghosts me. Said I was thinking about offing myself to 1 of them (havnt talked to this 1 friend since highschool just recently started talking and hung out 1x) I had a crush on them in highschool they are very aware of it but years after I see this person as a friend, nothing more. 

They said to go get therapy but I can't because I have no insurance, can't get a job because legally I can't drive due to double vision nor can my mom drop me off at any job because of her own job. 

I try to be social like going to a local fair we have every year but I have no friends and my mom won't go with me.

I have ADHD, Panic Disorder, BPD (I think it's autism because it doesn't happen unless I'm over stimulated) OCD, and insomnia.

Havnt seen a physician in 4 years so no telling what problems I have physically.

I forget to drink water and eat. My right kidney is in constant pain, severe migraine. I can't ask for help because my brother needs mental help and has asked for some help, I don't want to worry my mom and family because they think I'm doing so good and I'm happy. 

Truth is, I'm scared to be happy because for over 20 years , I'll be doing good in life, happy ect. Then shit hits the fan, rinse and repeat.
 
Don't want to be happy anymore I just want to die. My grandmother offed herself June 16 a few years ago. As little as I met her as a child around June I'm nothing but depressed and when I realize what month it is it hits different. I can't off myself because I know it would push a family member to drink again and I can't do that to them plus if I fail I'll be admitted back to the ward. 

I will not go out of my way to off myself but at the same time I'll just let natural selection happen and hope it does the job.

I have ADHD as well and that just makes it feel impossible. I’ve been binging on fast food and soda every day. I’m indulging in my expensive hobby more than I should. I buy things whether I have the income for them or not.

My current bipolar meds really don’t seem to be helping and I haven’t had ADHD meds for months now.

This made quitting weed cold turkey quite easy, but since the medication I was taking was on backorder for months, I fell right back into the cycle.

With that being said I am completely unmedicated and never even had time to find anything that helped me. Life is getting really really hard.

My friend who I was living with didn’t take care of her cat and would always leave the kitchen a rotting mess, and one day I got the idea to cut off my last friend.

,bipolar,"Hello beautiful people!

As many of you, the second my doctor said anything to me, I immediately googled ""doctor thinks I'm bipolar reddit"" and ended up here. I'm gonna go ahead and apologize bc this will be a long one.

I'm a 33f, always been described as bouncy, fluffy and basically a hyper person. It's something managed and dealt with my whole life. I get extremely productive spikes and then will randomly just be an absolute goblin refusing to do even basic needs like taking a shower. 
I collect hobbies, diving into them feverishly, only to randomly lose all interest, allowing stuff to sit on a shelf never or rarely to be messed with again.
I will be the best, most attentive friend and then fall off the face of the earth.
I am incredibly spontaneous and will randomly just decided to take off for the day but at the same time panic about walking into a Lowe's because idk 🤷🏻‍♀️

These are all things I've managed. I've also had social anxiety, but it was mainly centered around new situations and would generally go away once I was actively in those moments. I found smoking the devil lettuce was also something I really only enjoyed doing by myself as it would spike my social anxiety around people.

However in Mar. 2023, I had three sicknesses back to back. Nothing major but enough to take it's toll, the last one being possible strep so I was put on amoxicillin. 

About day two into amoxicillin I was out in my garage, normal day, took a hit off a bowl (I've always been an extreme light weight so I stick to flower and maybe two hits is all I need) then went inside.

I suddenly had a massive breakdown. Extreme panic attack. Had to call my s/o to come home.

The next 2 weeks was a state of nothing but panic attacks. Constantly in the mornings. I could not escape my head. My thoughts were racing so fast that it made me feel like every second I was about to take off running. I felt absolutely out of my mind and yet paralyzed inside of it. Could not stop the panic attacks so went to my doctor. In that time I also entirely stopped smoking weed and drinking caffeine as it was proving to be a trigger. I still have not resumed either of those things.

At first she was sure it was a thyroid storm brought on by the sicknesses. However after three different blood tests, urine test and even a EKG everything came back... Fine. My thyroid was perfectly healthy. In that time she had put me on Propanol to lower my heart rate (as it was elevated when she saw me) and given Lorazepam for spikes (that stuff was wonderful at making me feel almost normal again but I avoided taking it unless absolutely necessary bc of potential for addiction) 

So she went on to give me stuff for a possible anxiety related illness. Continue Lorazepam only for spikes and wanted to start me on Lexapro (5mg as I am very small 104 pounds and previously all medications I've needed a lower dose) Lexapro was an absolute nightmare. I was back to the peak of the episode that started this whole thing. Stuck inside my head, mornings I was an absolute jittery mess on the edge of panic attack. I would have to get up 3 hours before I needed to leave the house because I'd spend 2 hrs laying in bed in an attempt to calm myself enough to just get ready for the day. Zero appetite, zero sex drive (least of my problems) extremely irritable. 

For some reason I convinced myself I was being dramatic and stuck it out for a week before I reached out to my doctor who immediately said I needed to stop taking it. 

Within 4 days things leveled back out, I still don't feel like who I was before this whole thing started. For context I was VERY happy. I had, in the passed two years, finally fell in love with.myself. I enjoyed who I was, was very confident in myself and loved life. I barely had any sort of anxiety. Now I no longer can have coffee, can smoke to relieve stress (those two really are just kind of sad not my main issues) I live with anxiety every single day. The mornings still being the worst part of it. But no longer spiraling like I was at the beginning of this or on the Lexapro. 

Once things leveled, my doctor had me answer a bunch of questions. She even said she was so surprised bc at the start of this she could of swore it was just a thyroid storm. However I never really had told her about any of my daily issues, bc before this, they really were not something that bothered me. I loved when I became wildly productive and yes it did suck when I'd suddenly lose it half way through some random project but I managed. After speaking she has stated she believes i could be bipolar and asked if id be comfortable trying medication for it. 

I have to admit, after the Lexapro I am very very apprehensive. It took me right back to when this whole ordeal started and it was terrifying. Every day felt like a month and I was physically fighting it felt like just to do basic tasks. But I also know that whatever started all this wasn't medication and could happen again. I just want to be back to the person I was before all this, if that's even possible. 

I guess I am attempting to see if my experience matches any of you here. I must admit I don't know very much about bi polar and if any of this are things you've all dealt with. I'm looking for information, I haven't given my doctor a yes or no yet. As of right now I am ""ok"" (again not who I was before all this still very low energy, higher anxiety and just not myself) but I worry about doing nothing. Any advice or insight on this absolute girthy tale is going to be VERY appreciated.

,bipolar,"Tl;dr: what healthy coping mechanisms do you like to do to keep yourself grounded when you are feeling psychotic or in a highly manic state?

Hi everyone, I am currently awaiting a diagnostic interview this week with my therapist but her, myself, and my family think I may have Bipolar I with psychosis. I am between meds because the last one was giving me heart arrhythmia and the pharmacy won't have the new one until tomorrow so I am just sitting here trying to keep myself level-headed as the mania symptoms return. 

The thought disorganization is getting really bad and I'm growing increasingly worried about the weird delusions returning. How I am feeling physically, cognitively, or emotionally changes so quickly it's hard to feel settled. I thankfully have a great support system here with my family and therapist (my psychiatrist is kinda so-so, but whatever) so I do feel safe.  However, every step of this has been about dealing with new sensations and cognitive contortions that I would love to know what you fellow sufferers of Bipolar Disorder do to cope in the moment when the mania is overwhelming.

I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ll start using again the second I get manic. For those in recovery, what do you do to keep on track?&lt;/p&gt;

# Again?

&amp;#x200B;

Again? -

I thought as I emerged from depression.

Once I'll want myself dead,

And next day I’ll get it out of my head?

Thursday in bed will linger long,

But on Friday, I'll find out it's wrong!

I wonder when, devoid of the sense of being,

I'll surrender my dreams and every feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Again? -

I thought as I emerged from mania.

In January, I still felt like a God.

So why in February I’m not?

Will I believe in my head's fantasy

That causing harm to others is my destiny?

In a state without any reflection,

Will I with someone get an obsession?

&amp;#x200B;

Again.

Like Sisyphus, I carry my health uphill,

Only for it to slip from my grasp and fall into the pit.

Knowing that I'll never be truly well,

I grasp the stone, hoping still.

Even if I comprehend the absurdity of my fate,

,bipolar,"I’m having these really weird spells lately and wondered if anyone has had the same experience/knows what this is. 

Basically I’ve been on two big stressful international trips the past two weeks, which my psychiatrist strongly cautioned against (not going was not an option). So I knew this would have some effect on me since travel is one of my triggers, but I have no idea what is going on right now. I was in a medium depressive episode before leaving, which has felt a bit exacerbated since beginning the trip. But after a few days I started to get very disoriented, having a hard time hearing/understanding what people are saying when they speak to me, sleeping all the time and even sleeping through my alarms which I’ve never done before. I think I had one small visual hallucination but still am not sure. This got a bit more extreme at the worst possible time when I was going through an airport to get to the second part of my trip. I was overtaken by what felt like extreme fear and confusion and couldn’t understand what was going on around me or what people were saying, and I could tell that no one could understand me either. I remember feeling trapped in my head and thinking that I wanted to go to the hospital except not in the country I was currently in. This went away after a few hours but I was completely freaking out. I even listened to a voice note I sent to someone and can hear that my voice was very weird and slow. 

I’ve continued to be exhausted and disoriented and having a harder time understanding people since then and sometimes the panic/fear kicks back in for a while again. Has anyone experienced this? It’s a new one for me. I won’t see my psych for a few more weeks unfortunately.

I’ve been *so f’in depressed* lately and just want to hear some inspiring stories about others being in a healthy, *long term,* committed relationship with someone who has bipolar. 

I want to hear from individuals who’ve been together for years and years and years, not from people in 2 or 3 year relationships. I’m looking for lifelong and want to hear from those who are in those relationships because of this.

,bipolar,"Hi. To start out with I’m a 24 year old gay male, who has had slight behavioral and mood problems since my mid teen years. Lots of issues at home as a kid, psychological and physically abusive step parents you know? 
Well my issues continued to get more and more frequent as an adult. Then when July hit last year, everything in my life absolutely blew up. I stopped sleeping, eating, caring about the state of my home. Calling off work frequently to the point I almost lost my job. Had black outs in memory, to the extent where I “woke up” on the ground in a corn field in the middle of a small thunderstorm. I had drove my car 7 miles away from home and parked on the side of the road near the field and walked through one of the plow lanes and fell back. I don’t know how long I was there. I don’t remember driving there or walking through the fields. I started hearing things, at home and at work. People calling my name when nobody was around, I heard my grandma talking to me. And she’s been dead for 12 years. Then it got to the point of hallucinations. Then I’d start to see my grandma, and the worst part was when I walked into my house and saw my stepfather running at me fist raised. He had been dead a year at that point and I hadn’t seen him in 9. Along with those I was seeing people in the darkness, watching me wherever I went. In the shadows of my house and at work. And at times it’d be like I had a United Nations Council going on in my head with so much talking I couldn’t comprehend it. And other times it would only be 4 or 5 voices at a time, and they would all sound like me, but they’d all say different things and it was like all the different parts of me were telling me what to do. As a result, one day when my head was splitting from all the congestion and screaming I took one of the things I was working on at work (I’m a welder), and pressed it deep into the exposed flesh under my PPE. That started to make things easier, it hurt so much I was able to focus on that instead of the circus I was seeing and hearing. So that’s what I kept on doing. Now despite this, I knew everything I was seeing and hearing wasn’t real. I knew my grandma and stepfather were dead. I knew the shadow people I kept seeing weren’t real. But the burning was the only way to help. There would be periods of time where I’d be okay, I wouldn’t sleep but I wouldn’t be tired. And then I’d start sleeping with any and all men who would have me without a second thought. That lead to me being sexually assaulted and almost killed at the hands of a dangerous man. But despite that I’d continue. I maxed out my credit cards within a month and was $10,000 in debt. I’d spend paychecks on things I didn’t need and then couldn’t pay my bills. And I started drinking more frequently, but not enough to where I’d be considered an alcoholic. I put myself in more dangerous situations. Speeding 20-40 miles over the limit, passing cars with cars approaching closely on the other side, trespassing on the stone quarry near my house, trying to climb the water tower near my house (and failing because it was raining and I kept slipping), wearing my headphones with loud music and my eyes closed on highly trafficked train tracks. 
Finally one day one of my coworkers was messing with me to the point where I thought I was hallucinating again. And it got to the point where I ran from work without a word to anyone. I went to the mental health clinic at my home town which was 12 miles away. After filling out the paperwork it took 3 weeks to get in with a clinical psychologist. When I did I told her everything, it took 4 sessions over a month to get everything in the air. 
My friends and family were unaware of the self harm. But they all agreed that at that time the psychologist should have had me hospitalized. 
She got me set up with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, who diagnosed me with Bipolar 1 with acute mania and psychotic disorder after reading everything in my chart and talking with me. And after my diagnose, my mother revealed that she received the same diagnoses after a suicide attempt 7 years past when she was in a psychiatric facility. She said based on her mother and her grandmother’s life and behavior they likely had the same.
