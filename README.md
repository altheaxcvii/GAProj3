9th June 2023 - Charles
Workflow:

We will be using github to commit our files and any changes we would like to make.
We will have different files for different parts of the project, unlike our Project 2. This means that there will be seperate Scraping, Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Training 1 and Model Training 2, and Streamlit App files.
I would recommend everybody start learning and getting acquainted with making commits and branches via github this weekend. My repo can be used as a test and I'll be putting some practice ipynb, pptx, readme and py files for us to practice on during break/after class whenever we have some time.
